<h1>🐍 Python Crash Course Exercises</h1>

<h2>📘 Overview</h2>
<p>
This repository contains my solutions to exercises from <i>Python Crash Course</i> by Eric Matthes. 
It documents practical, incremental development of Python proficiency through structured hands-on work.
</p>

<h2>🎯 Purpose</h2>
<p>
The objective of this repository is to build a dependable foundation in Python for security engineering, automation, and general software development. 
Each exercise reinforces core programming concepts and clean coding practices required for cybersecurity and technical roles.
</p>

<h2>🧠 Learning Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li>📌 Progress through the book in order, completing each exercise with minimal, clean, and functional code.</li>
  <li>📌 Maintain consistent naming conventions and formatting across all scripts.</li>
  <li>📝 Store personal takeaways, summaries, and deeper notes in the <code>notes/</code> directory.</li>
  <li>⚙️ Ensure each script is runnable and self-contained before committing.</li>
  <li>📈 Use Git commits to track growth and technical progression.</li>
</ul>

<h2>📚 Book Contents Covered</h2>

<p>Following are the chapters I have completed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>📍 Chapter 1: Getting Started</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 2: Variables and Simple Data Types</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 3: Introducing Lists</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 4: Working with Lists</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 5: If Statements</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 6: Dictionaries</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 7: User Input and While Loops</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 8: Functions</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 9: Classes</li>
  <li>📍 Chapter 10: Files and Exceptions</li>
</ul>

<h2>▶️ How to Run</h2>
<ul>
  <li>🐍 Ensure Python is installed (version 3.x).</li>
  <li>📂 Navigate to any chapter directory.</li>
  <li>▶️ Run individual exercise scripts directly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 Reviewing the Code</h2>
<p>
Each script is intentionally simple and focused on a single task to demonstrate clarity in logic and structure. 
Complex explanations and long problem statements are omitted from the files to maintain readability. 
Questions or extended context are documented in accompanying notes where necessary.
